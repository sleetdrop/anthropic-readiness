# Stage A completed locally

The approved 12-task Stage A plan is complete on branch `feat/stage-a`.
Read [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md), [the evidence manifest](harness/handoff.json),
[the progress record](harness/progress.md) and
[the implementation ledger](harness/implementation-ledger.md) before further work.

## Report presentation follow-up

The owner approved a bounded readability improvement after the first private
assessment. The current renderer adds a plain Chinese overview, case table, grouped
verified field/model explanations and technical appendix (presentation 1.1).
See [the report ledger](harness/report-readability-ledger.md). The original assessment
and frozen Stage A artifacts stay unchanged; prior image/visual acceptance is not
new acceptance for this renderer. No new API request was made.

## Verified Stage A delivery baseline

- Verification commit: `be168d9962ff3dacd5e480818dd537d9f3438593`. Subsequent handoff-only
  commits update excluded records; source, lock, API bundle and image context stay identical.
- Linux Python 3.12.15 Dev Container and supplemental Python 3.11.17 full graphs
  each passed 166 tests with zero failures, errors or skips. The fast graph passed.
- Final arm64 native and amd64 emulated image jobs passed builds, prepared/disconnected
  dev full checks, nonroot read-only runtime replay, isolated synthetic peers, output
  persistence, SIGINT/SIGTERM and a generic Docker Desktop host-alias path.
- One independent whole-stage review is complete. Six Important findings and two
  regraded documentation defects were fixed in one author RED-to-GREEN pass.
  No re-review or deferred minor remains. Do not repeat this completed review.
- Wheel and sdist are in ignored `artifacts/distribution/be168d9/`; the exported wheel
  was installed and exercised offline in a fresh Linux environment outside source.
- Reports and exact local artifact hashes are listed in the handoff manifest.
  These observations are synthetic developer acceptance, not endpoint certification.

## Next work requires its own scope

Stop at A. B owns tool loops, parallel cases and version matrices; C owns real
Claude Code workflows; D owns protocol-update Agent tooling and later maintenance.
The sole API bundle is Messages 2023-06-01 core revision 1.0.0, with no betas.
Capture writers use schema 1.1; readers retain conservative 1.0 support.

The frozen offline handoff did not run a real endpoint. An owner-authorized private
post-handoff assessment has since completed; see [the validation ledger](harness/validation-ledger.md).
Its four behavior checks passed, but the selected protocol/identity contract failed;
do not describe the target as fully compatible. Remote CI and registry publication
remain unrun. Remote repository
creation/push, registry publishing, account setup and real API execution require
the owner's specific authorization. Keep private targets, credentials, original
logs and the historical evaluation workspace outside source/build contexts.
Local commits and synthetic checks remain authorized.

Use the checked-in Linux/Python 3.12 Dev Container for development. The existing
prepared Dev Container is retained; its identifier is an ephemeral local detail.
The completed plan's scratch workspace is archived locally and removed; its
permanent ledger is tracked under docs/harness.

For future network preparation, retain the original source and wait patiently.
The user requested roughly ten-minute download-progress polling.
